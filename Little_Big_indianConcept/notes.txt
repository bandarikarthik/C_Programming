Just learned about Motorola/Big Indian format.

Intel/Little indian will be exctly opposite.


How to remember?? tip. 
in CAN Document if data is present like this for 2 bytes 

HByte		LByte
AB 			 CD  

D0			 D1


0xABCD is data then it is Motorola (Big indian)
Remember Motorola only.


Number system format:
---------------------

To illustrate, consider the hexadecimal number 0x76543210;.
This 32-bit integer is composed of four bytes: 76, 54, 32, and 10.

Big endian format:
------------------

Byte address | 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x03 | 0x04 |
Byte content | 0x76 | 0x54 | 0x32 | 0x10 |

  0xABCD
MSB    LSB 
 
In Higher address, LSB value will be stored.
