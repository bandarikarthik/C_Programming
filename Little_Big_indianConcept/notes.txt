Just learned about Motorola/Big Indian format.

Intel/Little indian will be exctly opposite.


How to remember?? tip. 
in CAN Document if data is present like this for 2 bytes 

HByte		LByte
AB 			 CD  

D0			 D1


0xABCD is data then it is Motorola (Big indian)
Remember Motorola only.


Number system format:
---------------------

To illustrate, consider the hexadecimal number

Big endian format:

  0xABCD
MSB    LSB 
 
In Higher address, LSB value will be stored.


LittleEndian:

Lower byte lower address stored.
